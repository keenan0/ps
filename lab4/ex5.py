I did this with both my sisters, and the results are quite similar.

A
Frequencies from [0:5kHz] are present, while [0:2kHz] are very proeminent

E
The frequency range is still [0:5kHz], but frequencies [800:1.8kHz] are very insignificant 

I
Powerful [0:1kHz] along with [2kHz:5kHz]

O
Strong [0:1kHz] with less powerful [1kHz:2kHz] frequencies

U
[0,1kHz], that's it :)
